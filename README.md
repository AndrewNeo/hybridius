Hybridius is a tiny Python-based shorturl application. It supports both custom and random shorturls.


Installation
---
1. Install `requirements.txt` with pip
2. Copy `data/hybridius.settings.default` to `data/hybridius.settings` and modify settings as needed. CHANGE THE KEYS!
3. Run it however you host a Python webserver


Future
---
* Caching (in-memory, memcached, Redis)
* Mixed file hosting (Hybridius was originally intended to be a mixed target and static content shorturl service)
